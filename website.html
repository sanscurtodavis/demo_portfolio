                    environmentalism, and programming. Throughout my five years

                        <p>Creating a Snake game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is a fun project for developers 
                            who want to improve their skills in front-end web development. I created a game board, 
                            a snake that moves around the board, the players score, and food for the snake to eat. 
                            JavaScript is used to handle the game's logic, such as controlling the snake's movements, 
                            detecting collisions, and updating the score. HTML and CSS are used to design and layout 
                            the game board, snake, and food. Overall, building a Snake game using these technologies 
                            is an enjoyable way to practice front-end web development and improved my coding skills.</p>

                            key data for quarterly reports. In my free time I enjoy playing Pokémon, so I thought 
                            to create an analysis using a Pokémon database and Power BI to figure out which types of
                            Pokémon would be best for each generation of the game. I first uploaded the data into
                            Power BI and then used Power Query to clean and trim the data so it would only have the
                            key points I was looking for. Then I used a variety of visualization tools to demonstrate
                            a proficient summary of each Pokémon based on its data type.</p>
