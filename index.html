                            Building an options trading bot using Python and the Black-Scholes model is a rewarding project for those interested in financial technology and algorithmic trading. I developed the bot to execute trades based on various strategies, including vertical spreads, iron condors, and calendar spreads. The bot leverages Python to implement the Black-Scholes model for option pricing, allowing for precise trade execution. I configured it to handle different parameters and strategies, providing real-time analysis of key metrics such as PnL, win/loss ratio, and other performance indicators. This project not only enhanced my skills in quantitative analysis and programming but also offered valuable insights into developing effective trading algorithms.

                            For this project, I developed a sentiment analysis tool to evaluate stock news headlines and analyze their correlation with stock price changes. Using Python and the VADER sentiment analysis library, I assessed the sentiment of each headline, classifying them into positive, negative, or neutral categories. I then integrated data from financial APIs to track historical stock prices and used MySQL to store and manage the data. By calculating percentage changes in stock prices and analyzing their correlation with sentiment scores, I provided valuable insights into how news sentiment might impact stock prices. This project not only enhanced my skills in data analysis and web development but also demonstrated the practical application of sentiment analysis in financial markets.

I utilized a MySQL database to store and manage the extensive dataset, ensuring efficient retrieval and organization. The Power BI dashboard provided a comprehensive view of different PokÃ©mon attributes, allowing for detailed analysis and insights which I was able to customize using Microsoft Power Platforms and DAX. This project not only honed my skills in data scraping and database management but also enhanced my ability to create dynamic visualizations and perform in-depth data analysis.

                            Creating a Snake game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS was one of my first programming projects in college and proved to be an invaluable learning experience. I designed the game board, implemented the snakeâ€™s movement, and handled the gameâ€™s logic using JavaScript. This project introduced me to fundamental programming concepts such as using classes to manage game entities, defining functions to control game behavior, and employing analytical thinking to solve problems like collision detection and score tracking. Building the Snake game not only enhanced my front-end web development skills but also laid a strong foundation for more complex programming challenges.
