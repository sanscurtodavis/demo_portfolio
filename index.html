                    <p>
                        As an Operations Analyst, I streamlined trademarking processes by liaising with traders, ensuring seamless execution across financial markets. I developed custom web applications using React, Django, and SQL to showcase key indicators, optimizing workflows for reinsurance and Brazilian exchanges. Additionally, I conducted comprehensive data analytics using Python, SQL, and VBA for PnL summarization, providing valuable insights for decision-making. I also automated cryptocurrency analysis and relegation EV summaries, enhancing reporting efficiency. This experience in the financial field broadened my programming perspective and deepened my understanding of technology’s diverse applications, enriching my ability to develop impactful solutions across various sectors.

                        <p>Creating a Snake game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is a fun project for developers 
                            who want to improve their skills in front-end web development. I created a game board, 
                            a snake that moves around the board, the players score, and food for the snake to eat. 
                            JavaScript is used to handle the game's logic, such as controlling the snake's movements, 
                            detecting collisions, and updating the score. HTML and CSS are used to design and layout 
                            the game board, snake, and food. Overall, building a Snake game using these technologies 
                            is an enjoyable way to practice front-end web development and improved my coding skills.</p>

                            key data for quarterly reports. In my free time I enjoy playing Pokémon, so I thought 
                            to create an analysis using a Pokémon database and Power BI to figure out which types of
                            Pokémon would be best for each generation of the game. I first uploaded the data into
                            Power BI and then used Power Query to clean and trim the data so it would only have the
                            key points I was looking for. Then I used a variety of visualization tools to demonstrate
                            a proficient summary of each Pokémon based on its data type.</p>
